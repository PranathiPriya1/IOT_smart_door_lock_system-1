Smart Door Lock System Simulation with Arduino
OVERVIEW
This Smart Door Lock System is a simulation project designed using Tinkercad, a popular online platform for simulating electronics projects. The system aims to demonstrate the basic functionality of a keypad-based door lock system using Arduino Uno, a Servo Motor, a 4x4 Keypad, and an LCD Display. This project is a great starting point for understanding electronic security systems and can be used for educational purposes or prototyping smart home security solutions.

COMPONENTS
Arduino Uno: The central microcontroller that controls the logic of the door lock system.
Servo Motor: Acts as the physical lock, turning to open or close the door.
4x4 Keypad: Allows the user to enter a code to unlock the door.
LCD Display: Displays messages and feedback to the user, such as "Enter Code" or "Access Granted".
Jumper Wires: Connects the components to the Arduino.
Breadboard: An optional component used for making connections and prototyping.

HOW IT WORKS
The system starts with the door in a "locked" position, with the Servo Motor turned to block the door's opening mechanism.
The LCD Display prompts the user to "Enter Code" using the 4x4 Keypad.
When the user enters the correct code, the Servo Motor turns to the "unlocked" position, allowing the door to open.
If the code is incorrect, the LCD Display shows "Access Denied," and the door remains locked.
After a short delay, the system resets, allowing the user to try again or enter a new code.

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
Setup: Assemble the components as per the circuit diagram. Connect the Servo Motor to one of the PWM pins on the Arduino, the 4x4 Keypad to digital pins, and the LCD Display to the I2C interface.
Programming: Upload the Arduino sketch to the Arduino Uno. The sketch contains the logic for checking the code, controlling the Servo Motor, and updating the LCD Display.
Operation: Start the simulation in Tinkercad and interact with the 4x4 Keypad. Enter the correct code to unlock the door and an incorrect code to see the "Access Denied" message.

CONCLUSION
This Smart Door Lock System Simulation provides a basic yet functional demonstration of a keypad-based door lock. It can be extended or modified to include additional features like code reset, additional security checks, or integration with IoT platforms. This project is ideal for anyone interested in electronics, Arduino programming, or smart home security systems.
